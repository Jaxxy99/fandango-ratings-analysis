# Data Analysis & Visualization Project  

This project focuses on practicing **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using Python’s data science libraries. The Project Covers An Analysis Of Film Ratings Of A Website Called Fandango , Its A Website For Booking Movie Tickets And We Are Interested In Knowing Whether The Website Is Fraudulent Or Not Due To Confilcit Of Interest Between Giving A Fair Rating For A Movie And Selling The Most Amount Of Tickets.

##  Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to:  
- Explore and clean a real-world dataset  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand trends and patterns  
- Visualize findings using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**  
- Summarize actionable insights from the data

##  Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** → Data wrangling and cleaning  
- **NumPy** → Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** → Data visualization

##  Dataset  
This is the data behind the story [Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandango’s](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) openly available on 538's github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data. There are two csv files, one with Fandango Stars and Displayed Ratings, and the other with aggregate data for movie ratings from other sites, like Metacritic,IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes.

##  Key Steps in the Analysis  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Converted data types  
   - Removed duplicates and unwanted data 

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, correlations, etc.)  
   - Distribution plots and histograms  
   - Grouped summaries  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts  
   - Identified trends, relationships, and outliers

##  Insights & Findings  
- It has been found That Fandango Is Giving At Least 3 Stars For Films That Have Scores Between 1.2-1.9 On Average On All Other Sites
- There Is A Fraudulent Behavior In Fandango Scores Due To Confilict Of Interest Between Giving The Movies An Actual Review And The Desire To Sell More Movie Tickets
